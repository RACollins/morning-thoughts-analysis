Okay, so let's talk about today's topic. It's something that's been on my mind—something I haven't really heard being spoken about before, at least not at length. That is the ability to essentially download a person's personality and store it as a large language model (LLM).

I have heard conversations about this. I think it was in the US sitcom *Friends*. I’m not sure, but anyway, all an LLM is, is a very complicated and sophisticated network of edges—weights of probability. The result of a particular input is just dependent on the weights of the LLM.

And really, when you think about it, is our personality not just a probability distribution? How likely it is that we select a certain word after another set of words—is that not just what an LLM is? This is basically our personality.

So if we had an LLM with enough parameters—trillions of parameters, let’s say—would it not be possible to then use an entire corpus of someone's speech? The idiosyncrasies captured in the corpus, over a wide range of different settings—technical documents, casual conversations, anything—and then train the LLM based on that corpus? We may not even need to train an LLM fully, but perhaps just fine-tune an LLM.

I find this hasn't really been talked about, and I wonder why. It does seem to be a very difficult and technical feat, but maybe it's not all that interesting for people. I'm sure there are some very rich people who are already thinking about this. Being able to save your personality as an LLM would essentially mean that you could live forever—if you download it and then interact with it once the person is dead.

I have a similar idea. It's basically the goal of this project here: me recording my voice, taking the transcripts, and then using that corpus of text as a search database using some sort of RAG pipeline. Of course, it will not capture my personality, but the information that I have spoken about here will be available for the LLM as context.

Anyway, that's just something to think about. It could be something that I pursue in the future. Because although the technology, as it is today, is not adequate to achieve such a personality download, I'm sure it won't be long until such technology exists. And would it not be better to be at the forefront of a fledgling technology than it is to wake up one day and have it already fully formed?

It would require me to learn more about transformer networks, which I think suits my personality, actually. It suits my way of thinking. Let me give you an example. I find it very difficult to imagine or conceive of ways to make money from technologies. The conventional wisdom says that one should find a business problem and then engineer a solution for that problem using whatever technology is available at the time.

I often think about things in the opposite way. I discover a new technology, find it interesting, and then engineer a solution. I then go about looking for a problem that my solution solves. Of course, there might not be such a problem, rendering whatever I created with the new exciting technology completely useless—maybe not useless, but at least unwanted and unable to generate value for people beyond just an interesting tech demo.

However, this downloading of the personality—I’m sure some people would be very interested in that. Like I said, rich people who want to live forever. I already have a problem. So now I need to work backwards: go back to the fundamental technology, study its value, and then work towards a solution. Living forever as an LLM. Living forever as a large language model.

Things could get really freaky with video and voice. I don't want to think about that right now.

Yeah, I really should learn more about large language models and transformer networks. I get basically what's going on. I don't think it's necessary for me to build a larger language model from scratch. I don't have the resources for that. But at least I understand, at a fundamental level, what's going on—I think I do. Weights, the biases being updated, and trained on large corpora.

Anyway, going through that course I found online—Fast.ai. It looks pretty decent. Lots of people are raving about it, so I might as well give it a go, just watching the lectures. I don't know how fundamental the theory is. It's more of a practical course, but I’ll watch at least a few of the lectures.

Another technology I want to learn is automation, specifically with N8N. Again, I don't really have a problem in mind that I want to solve with it, but I have seen many problems being solved with it. I'm interested in the technology, so that should keep my motivation. And then it's just a case of searching around, talking to people, finding business problems.

There are already many—just nothing that really satisfies my interest. There'll be something there, I'm sure.

I want to go off topic a little bit now—talk about relationships. I see the online discourse around relationships, particularly with young men, and it's probably a bit shit. It looks like a complete mess. And it makes me very happy that I'm in a secure, long-term relationship with my wife. I'm also very happy that we have a daughter together.

I can't imagine being a young man in this day and age, slaving away on those matching apps—those dating apps. Although I was comparatively rather successful with those applications, I remind myself of just the horrible time I had at certain stages. How insecure everything was. How anxiety-ridden the whole experience was.

If you weren't actually in a relationship or on a date with someone that you liked, there was always a sense that you could do better, or that the person you're with is also speaking to five other potential partners, and you are just one of those.

I also remember how disappointed I was, actually, with the quality of interactions I had on such dating apps. It really is up to the man to lead the conversation. No, I'm not opposed to that. I think that's definitely fine. I think it's perfectly natural, actually, that the man would lead such an interaction. However, in my experience, an awful lot of the work was left to the man.

My wife today talks about the "catch ball"—how in a conversation, it's a little bit like throwing a ball to each other. When you have the ball, you speak. When you finish speaking, you throw the ball back. She often talks about interactions with her candidates in the job, and how there is no catch ball. The ball is thrown, and it's never thrown back. It's a one-way interaction.

That's exactly how I felt.

But anyway, yes, as I said, I'm very happy that I don't have to go through that experience again. Very happy.
