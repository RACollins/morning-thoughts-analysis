Good morning.

So, as usual, I don't really know what to talk about today, so I'll just make it up as I go along. I did have a very vivid dream last night. I was cycling through Somerset, through the Somerset Plains, cycling past Brentell. When I looked behind me, I could see across to Wales, to Cardiff, and I saw what looked like a volcanic eruption. But it wasn't actually an eruption — it was the debris of a rocket launch. A very nice rocket.

I'm not a rocket scientist or a military expert, but it looked like a nuclear warhead. I saw it being launched, but something must have gone wrong because the rocket wobbled. It fell to the ground a few seconds after launch. It looked like it fell somewhere around Bristol. And of course, there was a huge explosion.

At this point, I realised that something very bad had happened. I wasn't really in the dream anymore — I was just watching what was happening and trying to piece together what had gone on. Then it cut to many scenes of people fleeing, people arguing in Parliament.

My first thought was that this must be in response to something going on in Ukraine or in the Middle East, and my heart turned to: wow, this is such an embarrassment for the UK. It doesn't even have an effective nuclear deterrent. And what was the intended target? I don't know.

MPs were arguing in Parliament, setting off smoke detectors to suspend proceedings for the day. People were running on the beaches of Weston. It was all very dramatic. But it got me thinking — in the very cliché way — of death and what comes after.

Of course, none of us really know. None of us really know what happens after. But it also got me thinking about a documentary I watched — the documentary of the failed Titanic mission. The failed mission to visit the Titanic wreckage in a small submersible, the Titan, two years ago almost to the day. The Titan dove into the Atlantic Ocean with five members on board.

Of course, we know now that due to the intense pressure a few thousand metres down, the hull imploded, killing everybody on board. There was a strange time, a few days after the loss of contact with the Titan, when rescue teams were deployed and we were all told that if they had enough oxygen — which they did — then they would be able to be rescued. Of course, that sounds fanciful now, now that we know the facts.

But it got me wondering again about death, and how, although the details of an imploding hull so far underwater sounded very grisly, the reality is that the people experiencing the implosion, ironically, wouldn't have experienced anything at all. The implosion would have happened so quickly that it would have been beyond the reaction times of humans. So before the nervous system had registered the enclosure and sent its pain messages to the brain, there wouldn't have been a brain to send any messages to. There would have been no pain receptors, because it happened so quickly.

The occupants of the Titan would have been blissfully unaware of their demise. And it just got me thinking that that would be the perfect way of going: very quickly, without any knowledge, painless. Certainly much better than nuclear fallout.

Even if you were caught in the epicentre of the blast, there would have been those few seconds of dread just before the rocket hit the ground, where you knew this was the end. It would have been much worse for the people outside the initial blast area, as they would have died from radiation poisoning. Even inside the blast — though not in the epicentre — perhaps it would have been the worst: burning to death in agony. It may have lasted a few minutes, maybe a few hours.

I would much prefer to have been the occupant of the Titan, given the chance.
