Not actually a morning thought today—I couldn't get out this morning. I’m also actually thinking about stopping this early morning walk-around-and-talk-to-the-phone sort of thing because it's suddenly got very hot in Japan recently. It’s 30 degrees before 8 o’clock in the morning, which is very uncomfortable, especially wearing trousers. So I'm thinking of maybe just catching my thoughts wherever possible, still calling them "morning thoughts," but not necessarily recording them in the morning.

Anyway, nothing really to talk about much today. I've had a few thoughts about careers—about how one would formulate a career path. Something that intersects those four categories: something that you enjoy or that you're passionate about, something that will make you money, something that is good for society and the world in general, and something that you are good at. The intersection of all of these things.

Had a conversation yesterday with my wife, and we talked about how you don't necessarily need to like something for it to make money. Perhaps just choose a subject that is lucrative, and then as you start studying it and getting better at it, you then begin to like it and it becomes your passion. That's one way to look at it. Or you approach it the other direction—you just continue doing something that you enjoy, something that you like, and then, because you're so passionate about it, you'll stick with it through the hard times, through the really tough times, and eventually forge a path that way. And really, even if you don't make money, it's a good path to take because you'll enjoy it at least.

Anyway, I don't have too much more to talk about, so I'll finish there today. I think what I'll do is maybe write things down during the day, and then if I do continue doing this in the morning, at least I'll have some prompts to look at and then talk about as I'm walking around.

I guess I could talk about a few other thoughts I've had—creating a new application for this kind of talking-to-a-phone, capture-your-thoughts, link-them-together, process, organise, and then generate something from them. This app idea—I like this idea. Again, I don't know if there's a business opportunity for it. I don't know if I could monetise it, but again, it's something that I enjoy, at least at the moment, and would capture my interest for a good few months. I think it's also pretty good to work on my skills—AI skills, coding skills, things like that.

I could start with a base of creating an Obsidian plug-in, although apparently that's all written in TypeScript, which I'm not an expert in. But at least there's the base sort of note-taking application already made. And what I'm thinking about is very similar to that, but capturing through voice notes instead of writing. Obsidian is very good, but like I've said before in previous notes, it has a steep learning curve. Lots of functions, and it's quite overwhelming.

I'd rather just strip that back and allow the user to record one-minute voice notes, maximum, maybe. And then have them link together in some sort of organised manner—automatically organised. I think that's quite interesting. And then the real value-added part of it is generating something from those voice notes. You should also be able to query those notes in a sort of AI ChatGPT interface. I think that would be quite interesting.

But anyway, yeah, we'll finish there for today. And, yeah, thanks.
