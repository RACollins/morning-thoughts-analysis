So, I forgot to go walking this morning—well, not forgot exactly. I woke up in the middle of the night because my daughter was crying, and I felt very tired in the morning. So, I took that extra hour and a half to stay in bed.

Anyway, what I wanted to talk about today was just a little update on my business plan from the previous recording. I think it's a little unreasonable to ask people who are searching for jobs to pay, even just a small fee, to shadow another person's job. People who are looking for jobs are already price-conscious, so the monetisation model is just not going to work. That's just what I wanted to give—a little update on that.

I think I want to explore more about automation, especially AI automation. It seems that AI automations are getting a lot of publicity. People are opening their own AI automation agencies—one-man AI automation agencies. I see it on YouTube, I see it on Reddit, and to be honest, it seems like something that I could get into.

Some of the numbers that they say they are making—some of the money that they're making, you know, $10,000 a month plus—seem a little unreasonable. Although I'm sure some of these people are making that much money, it just seems to me that the people who are making the most money are actually making it from content—teaching other people how to become an AI automator. It seems a little disingenuous to me. They're not making the bulk of their money from the AI automations, selling them to companies, but actually they're making most of the money on the courses that they sell on the back of them being an AI automation guru.

Furthermore, I don't see a lot of these AI automation agency gurus niching down. I see them as general AI automation gurus, but not for any specific industry. I think that may be something that I could get into—maybe use AI automation in a niche. I wouldn't want to become the AI automation guy. I'd rather use the skill for some sort of business problem in some niche domain.
