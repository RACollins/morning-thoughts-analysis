Good morning. As always, I don't really know what I'm going to talk about today. I really need to write down the topics that I'm going to talk about the night before, so I can remind myself. Because when you wake up, you really have just nothing on your mind. But anyway, let's go for it.

I'm thinking about starting a YouTube channel. I'm sure I've said this already. In fact, I did say this already—I think it was yesterday that I said it. So I'm going to skip that.

I've started reading—just the books that we already have in the house. So I've started off with Jordan Peterson's *12 Rules for Life*, because I need to start doing something different with my life. I'm going to slowly stop playing games, I think, because I would just play for an hour every evening. I mean, that's not a lot, but it's an hour that I could be doing something much more productive. And I used to read a lot. I should get back into that, so that's what I'll do. I’ll use that hour in the evening, replace it with reading.

That's quite hard. I've seen that my reading speed is very slow. Maybe I'll get better with hands—80, yeah. Practice and improve. Who knows, really? Anyway, let's just see how that goes.

I'm going to be reading mostly nonfiction—well, it's almost entirely nonfiction—and around the sort of self-help, popular science, business-type books. Something that will, you know, benefit me. That's what I'm aiming for.

Yeah, and I just think that reading books about discipline—because it's difficult to read, it's difficult to concentrate for so long—it's not like I'm addicted to my phone or anything. I'm certainly not as bad as some people. I don't have social media, for one thing. Well, I have Discord, but it's not like I keep up to date with people or talk to people all the time. I don't post anything. I don't have Facebook anymore—for a few years now. I don't have Instagram—never did—or X, formerly Twitter. And the only reason why I would get these things is because of self-promotion, to link it to my potential business. Those are the only reasons.

So I'm not—I’m certainly not addicted, but I could have much more discipline if I tried. So that's what I'm going to do.

Yes, reading. Let's see how that goes.

Well, with very few topics to talk about, let's talk about large language models and fine-tuning a large language model such that the response is in the style of a certain author or public figure.

I've thought about developing a chatbot that mimics the style of Christopher Hitchens. I like to call it Hitchbot. So the idea is that I would get all—well, not all, as much as I could—of his writings, and then form question-response pairs and use those to fine-tune a large language model. Just an off-the-shelf version. Probably OpenAI, just because it's the easiest and most available model I could use. So I'm gonna go with that. Yeah, just see how it goes.

I made an analogy of what fine-tuning is—not quite what fine-tuning is, but what an LLM is and how it responds—in terms of music. With music, you have the melody, the content of the music. And then the context of the music would be what comes before and after the melody. And the style of the music would be the chords or the accompaniment, harmony to the melody.

So when an LLM responds, its content is like the melody. An LLM responds with a very honest, robotic style, so the chords or harmony are very plain, very average. Doesn't have a lot of flair. But the content is quite impressive—it's quite an impressive melody, even if the chords and harmony are kind of plain. So my attempt to fine-tune an LLM is to add extra melody and structure and harmony to the content. It worked in my head. I don't know if that makes sense when I speak it, but that's what I imagine I'm doing—adding polish to the content in the style of Christopher Hitchens.

I don't know if it's going to work. I think it would be better if I found interviews with Christopher Hitchens, because then it would be a question-response type thing. Also, if I do find texts of Christopher Hitchens' writings, then at least it forces me to read another book, and it's something that I should do, I guess.

I don't know how many examples I need. I read the documentation for fine-tuning. As I recall, about a hundred question-answer pairs is enough. I could start with 100, I think. To curate the whole list though—that's a bit much.

Anyway, I'll call it a day for now. If I think of anything else, I'll let you know.
