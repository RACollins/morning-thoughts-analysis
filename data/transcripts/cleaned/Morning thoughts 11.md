Good morning. I’m actually walking around today. It's become very hot recently, so I'm walking with sandals, shorts, and a T-shirt. It's actually quite pleasant. This is the new way I'm going to do things. It also forces me to walk a little bit slower.

As usual, I don't have any plans for this talk—just going to see what comes out. I would like to talk about what the purpose of this whole project is. I think it has some potential.

So what I'm trying to do is just collect my thoughts in the form of voice notes, transcribe them automatically—at the moment through the app's inbuilt transcriber, which isn't very good. It gets things wrong and just spits out what looks like text for people, which I need to tidy up. So that's it for the moment. But what I'm planning to do is automate that—probably use Apple's API. Sorry, not Apple's API—OpenAI's API—and then transcribe using Whisper.

Anyway, the user is also able to put written notes in as well. From there, I want the ability to automatically organise all of your notes. The big problem I find with note-taking apps like Obsidian is that there's a lot of overhead in organising your notes. It's a very basic app, and it gives you a lot of control. However, sometimes I just want to note ideas down and then leave them—have the organisation system work for me, by itself.

I don't want to have to bother with tags and links and files and things like that. Of course, that flexibility—that ability to do it yourself—is very good, but I just spend so long trying to think of the perfect organisational method that it takes away from just noting down the ideas and getting any use from them. So I want AI to organise my notes for me.

That's the first thing: organise my notes, merge similar notes together in case I've taken down multiple ideas, split larger notes into single ideas, and have them all in some sort of structured order. That's what I envisage. First, organising, distilling, splitting, merging into some sort of coherent order. Then I want to be able to use that structure as context for asking questions of an LLM.

For example, say I have many notes about my career—my preferences for a job, salary ranges, working hours, type of team, type of work. I then want to be able to ask the app to generate a CV for me based on those voice notes, and it should be able to understand which notes are important for the context of writing a CV.

Now, it's already an open-source project. There are a couple of open-source projects. One is OpenOrg-E—that's Open, O-P-N, Org, A-U-G, and then E is just the letter E. OpenOrgy, which looks a little bit like an Obsidian plugin, does the organisation step. I haven't tried it, but I've seen demonstrations, and it looks like the sort of thing that I want to do. It clusters groups of notes together.

The other one is MemZero—M-E-M Zero. That is a kind of summarising framework. It strips away a lot of the note, a lot of the text, and just extracts the essence—the information. It's meant to be used as long-term memory for chatbots, but I can see it being useful in my project too.

So that's where I'm heading with this. I think it has potential, and I want to be able to have some sort of application around it. Or maybe just play around with Obsidian. You could achieve a similar result, probably through Cursor—the IDE. Open Cursor at the root of the vault and then ask it to organise your notes for you. I think that might be possible. Give it instructions, give it the ability to make new files. I think that's probably the first step to try.

I mean, is it possible to do it just through Cursor? Maybe. I'm sure what I would like is achievable if I cobble together multiple different systems and frameworks. But having everything in one application is, of course, convenient. People pay for convenience. So that's what I’d like to do.

I don't know if it will make money—that’s the problem. It's a lot of work, perhaps with no benefit. So that's why I'm wary. We'll see. I've never been very good at making money. I just don't think I have that knack. I don't have that killer instinct.

I look at my salary now, and it's exactly the same as the salary I received when I first joined this company six years ago. It's not exactly the same, of course, but due to inflation, it is, in real terms, the same. It is kind of depressing. I've never had that killer instinct.

Watching a few YouTube videos of rich people—rich young people—made me realise that I'm never going to reach that level of income because I just don't have that mindset. I'm not that. And for me to expect to be as wealthy as them without changing myself is fanciful. I first need to attempt or move in a direction where I am more like those rich people. I need to change my behaviours. I need to be like those people.

The girl I was listening to yesterday said that basically all you need to do is behave like people who earn £100,000 a month, and then it's almost inevitable that you will also be able to generate—well, not be able to generate—but you will. It's inevitable that you will generate £100,000 a month.

Which seems... seems difficult. Seems incorrect as well. Just being like that person doesn't magic money. But I agree that it certainly creates an environment where such wealth generation is possible.

She also mentioned that value is where pain is alleviated. That makes sense. People pay a lot to relieve pain. They don't pay much for new fancy gadgets or technology. I don't know if my app's solution alleviates pain. It certainly alleviates my pain of trying to use Obsidian and just have everything organise itself.

I don't think it will work, actually. Anyway, I'll call it a day for now. Talk to you tomorrow.
