Okay, let's continue. It's a bit rainy today, so I didn't really have a plan. I didn't talk about that, okay? So let's just see what comes out.

I've been watching some videos about productivity, and it's interesting. What about dopamine? Of course, we all know about it. It's the chemical that gets released whenever you do something pleasurable. There's been lots of talk recently—over the last few years, I would say—about how people, adults and children alike, have become dopamine addicts.

A few examples of this addiction might be consuming short-form content on YouTube, Instagram, or TikTok. I hope to be kind of classy, and that sort of content can be great. So it's not just that app—TikTok—it's the fear that your data is being sold to or accessed by the Chinese government. That might be true. Also, I just don't particularly enjoy that sort of contact. Anyway, I digressed.

Content like pornography, alcohol, drugs—things of that nature—really open up the dopamine release in your body. It's a good feeling. It keeps you high. It's not necessarily that you're quite addicted, but also you get one hit of dopamine from here, then you seek the next one. You're just constantly seeking dopamine hits.

You know you can spend hours scrolling through your Instagram feed, being overstimulated by TikTok videos and all sorts of things. There's one particular video I saw on the subject, but the same idea seems to be repeated among other YouTube creators and videos. That's this idea of lowering your base dopamine level.

The way it goes is, if you have this type of addiction, then your day—as a graph of dopamine levels over time—can seem like a roller coaster. Instantly, when you wake up, you get that dopamine fix. Maybe it's caffeine, maybe it's scrolling the news. Not the caffeine, but scrolling the news gives you that little spike very quickly. Then what happens is it drops very dramatically. You feel kind of anxious, maybe even angry, because you don't have that dopamine hit.

Having a high level of dopamine tells the body that you're in a safe place, and you want to stay in that state. But it's like you're anxious—what's it about? A very high level, then you crash down very quickly. So what the body seeks out—and tells you to do very strongly—is go find some more. So you scroll through Instagram or Facebook or X, and you get that spike again. You feel good, and then the cycle continues throughout the day. You get this up-and-down, roller-coaster-type graph of dopamine levels.

The problem is, whenever you get that snap dip, you feel anxious and scattered, and you just want to get your next hit. I'm sure this has parallels with actual addiction.

So the idea is, how do we fix this? Of course, we don't want to live our lives like this. The solution is to stop consuming these materials that give you a high dopamine hit. It makes sense when you see that your goal should be to maintain a very low dopamine level throughout the day. One way to do that is to avoid overstimulating yourself with these addictive materials.

Instead of having coffee and scrolling the news in the morning—which I have to say, I don't think is particularly bad, because I’ve never really felt that effective. My dad and I don't feel much awake from it, and rarely use it a lot—but anyway, let's say instead of doing that, you get up and take a cold shower. You go for a walk. You do some exercise. These things stimulate you, but to a much lower level.

The idea is that because these other activities are so addictive, they give you such a great dopamine spike. Try and replace those with things that are stimulating to a much lower level. One particular guy—I can't remember his name—seems to be quite successful. A millionaire at 25, or however old. He said this is how he kept productive: by starving his body of all these highly addictive activities.

He would only allow himself to get his dopamine fix from doing work. That was all. Doing work might be composing emails, doing research, building a product. By doing that, your baseline level of dopamine stays very low throughout the day. You're not overstimulated. It also means that any slight stimulation makes you very excited, very happy. It makes you addicted to work.

He drew a graph of his dopamine levels. Of course, it's not scientific, but you could see it: very low dopamine level, and maybe during the evening, when work is over, he gets to see his friends or play some video games. But throughout the day, work is the only way he can get even a slightly higher dopamine hit—and that's a good style, by doing work.

I have a similar sort of cycle. I don't think in terms of dopamine exactly, but I categorize different activities like I would food.

There's the sugar category, which gives you a quick burst of energy but ultimately is unhealthy. Sugar includes processed food, high-sugar, high-salt, high-fat—all of that. And these sorts of activities include scrolling on social media, or worse ones like pornography, smoking, drinking. These all go into the sugar category.

Then there’s the whole wheat category. I can’t think of a better name. The vegetables, the grains—the things that are very good for you. They ultimately give you a lower level of energy, but it's more sustained. These types of activities are long-watching content, watching a long documentary, reading a book—things that span a long time. They're difficult, just like eating whole grains is difficult to digest, but that’s kind of the point. Ultimately, they sustain you much longer.

So, in my mind, I like to categorize these two types of activities just like a diet. We all know what’s good for us and what’s bad for us. We all know how different activities affect our neurochemistry. And just like a diet, we don’t stick religiously to a particular plan—although some people are very good at that—we mostly try to go for the salad, the whole bread, the healthier choice, as much as we can.

And then sometimes, we have the occasional chocolate or high-sugar yogurt. So, with our activities, most of the time, we’re working, we’re reading books, we’re going for a run—things like that. But then every now and then, we’re scrolling on social media. Every now and then, we’re playing a video game.

So I like to use that framework when I'm thinking about my productivity, thinking about what sort of activities I'm doing. I try to cut down the sugary content and increase my wholesome, grain-filled, fruit-and-veg content.

Anyway, I think that’s okay for today. I’ll sign off now. It’s raining a lot. I'm almost wet now. So, see you in the next one.
