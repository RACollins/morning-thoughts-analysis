Okay. So, just a short one—maybe the mornings aren't the best time to do these recordings. I tend not to have very many thoughts in the morning. My mind is blank after a long night's sleep, so I don't really have a lot to talk about.

Anyway, it's the only time I really get to do these sorts of things. Everyone else is asleep, and I get some time to myself, so I guess I'm just going to have to carry on with what I'm doing.

Anyway, I guess I can talk about what I'd like to do in my future. I don't really want to work in my job anymore. I think I've reached my limit with this job. I can't really progress any further without sacrificing some of my own personality.

I had my review a couple of days ago, and I realized that in order to go any further than I have right now, I'm going to need to talk to more people or actively seek out people to talk to about my projects. And that's not something I'm really interested in, particularly in a foreign language and in a foreign culture.

I probably could do it, you're right, but it would be such a sacrifice of the sort of person I am. I don't know if I can keep it up eight hours a day, five days a week. I'm finding it hard to communicate with my boss effectively. I'm pretty sure it would be even more difficult if it were someone who doesn't speak English, and I had to speak Japanese.

That's the reason why I'm not going to get any promotions. It's just because I haven't really put myself out there. I haven't really been proactive about my work. All I've really been doing is producing.

So, this has led me to really contemplate what I want to do with my career. And I think the best option for me is to go solo, although that makes me feel very anxious. It makes me very nervous because, of course, I've never done anything like that. I don't really have the confidence or conviction that anything I do is worth much money.

I'd have to be very proud. I'd have to be very confident in my abilities, which I think I am. I think I'm confident in my abilities. I just don't think I have a black-and-white, hot passion for something. It's the only thing to do solo.

But it's certainly the best thing to do, because I know I can take control of my own destiny. I'd be able to really conduct things to my own tune, to my own beat, march to the beat of my own drum—whatever the phrase is.

It's just going to be so difficult because I don't really have anything like a goal or a vision. I'm not a very social person as it is. It's going to be tough to make connections.

Anyway, these are just some small thoughts I had. I don’t have a lot more to say. I can't really think of anything else. Maybe I have to look more into that.
