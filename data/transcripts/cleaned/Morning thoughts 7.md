Okay. Very free-form today. I don't have any particular topics in mind, so we'll just see what comes out.

I went to the office yesterday, and maybe we can talk a little bit about what working from home has done to us in terms of careers and jobs, and things like that. I think it's clear right now that working from home hasn't really changed the value that someone can provide to their job. Of course, this is not always true. Some jobs require you to be in person, and that's inevitable—construction, nursing, things like that. But office jobs really haven't suffered that much by transitioning the work from the office to home.

In my case, when COVID hit, I almost overnight went from working in the office five days a week to being completely work from home, only going to the office very rarely—maybe to get my COVID vaccines, which were administered in the office, or to do my medical exam. It seemed a very stark contrast. I haven't really gone back to the office.

However, going back to the office yesterday, I did notice that my productivity was much, much higher. I had much better productivity. I think the reason for that is because with other people around me, I was forced to basically concentrate on my work. Perhaps if I were at home, I would maybe do some work, stand up, walk around, get some food, maybe lie on the sofa, have a little nap maybe. I would get my work done, but it would be much slower and less focused. Whereas at the office, like I said, I was forced to be focused, and I got quite a lot of work done.

This goes back to my previous topic of the sugar content or the sugar activities and the vegetable activities—or as I like to call them, the grain, the whole grain activities. They give you lots of energy, but spread out over a longer period. And I could definitely feel it. I could concentrate for well over an hour doing quite menial tasks—daily data manipulation. Managed to stay focused for almost two hours doing this very menial, basic data manipulation, whereas at home I think I'd struggle to do that. Too many distractions. Too easy to just slack off.

So yes, lots of whole grain activities carried out at the office. Another benefit, which has been talked about quite often, is that it's a more social experience. Of course, with everyone in the office, you get to have these cross-pollinations of ideas and bumping into people. I didn't really experience that yesterday, but obviously it's much more possible if everyone is in the office.

Some people might think that's a drawback of working in the office. I can understand that. I like to keep myself to myself. I don't necessarily need to be talking and chatting with colleagues, particularly for me in a different language. But it was just nice to be there and experience office life proper, you know. It made me feel like a real person with a purpose.

So in aggregate, it was good. I'm not going to the office today. No such plan. Maybe I take it a bit easier.

Another drawback is that I was just so tired at the end of the day. I'm not used to such activity—walking around, commuting. Commuting is not fun. But anyway, not a terrible experience.

It's a bit of a trite topic, but I'm going to talk about how to find one's purpose in life. It's something that, of course, I've been thinking about a lot recently—one of the reasons why I'm starting this voice recording analysis slash product thing.

It seems to be, and to a lot of other people, that your purpose in life is the intersection between four... four topics. Let's call them topics. Four goals.

Number one: you need to find something that you like—something that you like doing, something that you can do without effort, that you feel very natural doing.

Number two: something that is good for the world. You know, you could like murdering people and feel very little effort doing that, but of course, murder is not great for the world. So it has to be something good for the world.

Third: something that makes you money. It's all great doing something you love and, you know, follow your passion and everything like that, but if it doesn't pay the bills, it's not going to be a very good life purpose. You'll be a struggling artist forever, despite it being something you like and it being good for the world. So make sure you can make a living out of it. While it's proper, it's not a good purpose if it can't support you.

The fourth one—I’ve actually forgotten. I'm just gonna riff a little bit here. I can't remember what the fourth one was. Oh, was it: something you enjoy, something that is a benefit for the world, something that makes you money, and four... what was four?

I actually can't remember. Something that has a benefit to the world, something that you enjoy... Ah, of course! Something you're good at.

Maybe this one isn't so important, because if you enjoy it, and someone's going to pay you for it, well, I guess you've already reached a standard good enough to be paid for. So maybe that one isn't so important. But anyway, the fourth one is: something that you're good at.

Hmm. I'm tempted to drop that one. Anyway, I can't—I shouldn't—remember it. And being paid for it kind of covers that idea that you're good enough to do it. It doesn't matter if you're not very good at it, because you get paid for it, you enjoy it, and it's good for the world, so just carry on, I guess.

So yeah, these four goals should really be what you're aiming for when trying to find a life purpose. And, you know, it's all very well to define these things, but then actually focusing in on something that you can find in the cross-section between these four goals is quite difficult.

I like to play piano. It's something good for the world. I'm good at it. But not many people will pay me to do it. That's the problem, you see. I can't make a living out of it. Being a musician is always fraught with uncertainty. Your level of expertise or how well you play, or even how much joy you bring to the world with it, isn't proportional to how much you get paid for it. Trends come and go, and you might just not be the hot topic at the moment. So playing piano is out of the picture.

What else? Well, I'm good at
