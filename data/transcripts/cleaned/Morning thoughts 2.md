Okay, let's start the second voice recording. It seemed to have worked last time, so we'll just carry on with what I was doing.

What I wanted to talk about today is a few business ideas. I realised that starting with the idea is not really the right way of doing it. What you should really do is discover a problem — a pain point, as it's called — and then work backwards. Start with the result in mind, find the pain point, and then engineer a solution for it. People would pay for it because it solves a real problem. It also solves the problem of validating your idea because there's already demand for it.

I've never really gone with that method. I always have these ideas, and I'm trying to find a problem for them. It's a little strange — well, not strange, but definitely the wrong way of doing it.

So, I wanted to talk about a few business ideas. There are a lot of people out today, so I'm kind of being a bit quiet. A lot of people I walk past, I wonder if there's a quieter area that I can do this in. There are just lots of guys going to work, but I'm sure they don't really mind because they probably don't understand English.

Anyway, starting with a few business ideas. One of my grand ideas was Habit Slap, which is an automatic email service. What happens is, you write in a few details about yourself, your habit, your goal, and then every day you get a reminder email to work on your goal and stop slacking off.

I got the idea from Jason Levin, who did a similar thing called Elon Email. It's quite interesting. You email someone — who's actually an AI trained on Elon Musk's writing, tweets, interviews, things like that — about your business idea, and then he basically roasts you about your idea and tells you to stop messing around and just get on with it. I liked the idea, so I copied it and made Habit Slap. That's what that is.

Of course, monetising that is really difficult. Why would anyone pay for emails like that?

Lots of different business ideas recently. I've had the idea of creating a sort of marketplace of online courses. My idea is that on platforms like Udemy or Coursera, you can pay for courses in any subject and then, at the end, you get a certificate. That's all great, but if you want to learn something, you can probably find the material online somewhere — from YouTube, from blogs. People post free content all the time on any subject.

So if you were dedicated enough, if you did enough searching, then you'd probably find the free content online somewhere. Why not have a marketplace where users curate their own educational material around any subject? The incentive is that people might use your content and maybe you get an upvote for that. There may be premium tiers with special privileges. Basically, a curated marketplace of free courses to replace YouTube, Udemy, Coursera, and the like — because you can find all these things for free online. Let's just provide it for people. Use the community aspect to curate it for free.

I'm not sure how to monetise it, though. And I'm sure there are already free courses on these sorts of sites anyway, so I'm not really going to pursue that idea. Also, it seems like a lot of engineering work. I have no idea how to set up a marketplace. Although with AI code tools like Cursor, it probably wouldn't be as difficult as it used to be. But anyway, I'll shelve that idea.

Other ideas that I've had — well, this isn't really my idea, it's actually my dad's idea — and that is to, again, start with the end in mind. That would be to have your startup acquired by some larger firm. He reckons that it could be bought for somewhere in the region of £3 million in the next six years, which I find fantastical. But there you go.

So with that in mind, what sort of startup might be bought in six years’ time for £3 million? His suggestion is to go into finance, use my machine learning skills and knowledge to predict the market — stocks, forex, commodities, gold, silver, things like that.

I think he got the idea because with large language models these days, you can distill news stories very quickly, extract key pieces of information, and then relate that to the movements in the market, like you couldn’t do before. Although I’m sure these types of feeds were included in machine learning models to predict the market anyway, it's now become much quicker and more accurate.

Okay, it's not like I'd be the first person to try and predict the market using machine learning or some sort of AI. It seems like a fool’s errand. If many people before me have tried this and failed, what makes me think that I could do a better job with no experience of trading, markets, and with no real interest in that area? I'd be starting from zero and I may not even get anywhere. Is that really the best use of my time?

Well, let's think about it. I may not create or engineer the best predictive model. It may not even be the second best. But there's enough room for there to be at least a competitive model that some firms would use. I could probably go quite far with predicting stock crises.

But I pose the question: if I did such a good job, why would I want to sell my method to other people? Wouldn't I just sit back quietly and use this fantastic method to generate income? Why would I want to sell it if it's making me so much money?

And his response is basically, well, I wouldn't have the capital to really push this method as much as a large firm could. I don't have millions of pounds, whereas they do. So I can understand that point.

It would mean that I'd have to really dive deep into that area of things, and I'm a little hesitant. From the outside, the personalities involved in that area are a little bit odious. I'm not exactly turned on by that type of work or that type of person.

Of course, I'm actually a student, but starting with a few models just from my laptop and then building up to a seven-figure exit — I mean, it's appealing, but I'm going to have to work hard and sacrifice a salary for many years. I just don't know. I think it's a lot more promising than, for example, creating an AI-based app and hoping that does well. Certainly adds a lot of risk, yeah, because any of these apps could just be eaten up by the big players.

An idea that I've had recently is one where the user can take voice notes — you know, like you can already do on your phone. Then a transcript is generated. As you generate more of these voice notes — for your own purposes, to remember things, to note things down, to organise your life a little more — using large language models, you can then analyse all of this textual data in a meaningful manner. Beyond summaries, you could track your mood, do topic modelling, which I find quite interesting. In fact, it's what I'm trying to do with this series of voice notes, eventually.

I've looked around and it seems like most of these AI note-takers are based around wellness — some sort of meditation app with a voice capture attached to it. They boil down all of your voice notes into something coherent and then give you a meditation routine based on it. Sort of a mood tracker, habit tracker. Which is okay. It's just not really the angle I'm going for.

That's the thing with these sorts of apps — you can come at it from any angle. Maybe a business idea generator: talk into the voice capture about your business idea, such as I'm doing now, and then it uses those business ideas, checks the internet, does a deep dive on the subject type, and tells you if your business idea is good or not. Maybe that's an angle I could go for, rather than the wellness angle.

Another business idea I've had is this: let's say you're looking for a new job. Of course, you can read the job description, but that never really gives you a good idea of what the job might be like on a day-to-day basis. Wouldn't it be great if you could shadow someone in the role that you're applying for before you even apply?

This would work a lot better for remote work because you could sit in on meetings remotely. On-site jobs are a little more difficult. But essentially, you would shadow someone for the day. You'd pay a fee for that, and the person who is being shadowed — the person in the job already — would get a fee as well. You'd be able to ask questions, sit in on meetings that are not sensitive, and essentially complete a workday in that role.

It solves the problem from the candidate’s point of view because they get to experience what it's like. The employer’s benefit is that they can showcase their work to prospective employees, so there’s an incentive there. I'd have to work out the monetisation strategy a bit. I don’t know how much each party should be charged. There's also going to be a lot of questions about confidentiality. You can’t just be going around revealing company secrets.

You can imagine a situation where a prospective candidate is actually an employee of a rival firm. They go in and infiltrate, pretending to be a prospective candidate, but actually they're just there to spy on the rival firm. It’s not really about tech — it’s about people — so it's much more difficult to manage.

How about a new matching app, a dating app, where if you're matched with someone, then in order to speak with them, you have to first send an introductory video message? This is open to all sorts of abuse, as you can imagine, but it does make it a little easier to filter out the people that you're more likely to get along with. If you see just a 20-second video of someone, you get a much better idea of that person than you would from just reading a bio or seeing a few heavily filtered pictures.

I think it’s a much better way of getting to know someone. More of your personality is revealed in such a video. Matching apps are so difficult these days. I think people are getting fatigued. I don't exactly want to add more misery to an already miserable market.

But the overarching theme of all of this is that I'm starting with a solution and trying to find a problem for it — which is certainly not the way it should be done. The way it should be done is to find a problem and then engineer a solution for it.

To do that, I need to really look around certain industries, see where the pain points are, talk with prospective customers, and then try to engineer a solution that people would pay for. It’s not really my nature to do such a thing, though. It means I’m going to have to get out there, talk to people — online, in person. I'm much more of a pensive, introspective thinker, so it doesn’t really align with my personality very well. However, if I want to do this, it’s something I’m going to have to do.

I think we’ll call it a day.
