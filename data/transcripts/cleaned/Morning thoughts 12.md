Good morning. Um, I'm a little worried about my back. It's been, I think, about a week since I hurt it. And for the first day, it wasn't too bad. The next day—the day after I hurt it—it was really bad. And the day after that, it was also very bad. I had to bend over, sit up properly... I thought I had done some serious damage.

I went to the doctor, got some painkillers, which—disappointingly—were quite effective. And now I've been taking painkillers every day since. In the mornings, when the painkillers haven't kicked in, my back really hurts. I think every day it gets a little bit better, but it still hurts. It's not right. But if I take painkillers throughout the day, by the late afternoon, I'm basically fine. So, yeah, a little bit disappointed that I have to take painkillers to get back to normal. I'm trying to cut down on them, but this morning, it just hurts again. So, anyway, we'll see.

What I'd like to talk about today is personal growth again. I just want to recount a conversation I had last night with my wife. If we want to live the life that we want—if we want to achieve our goals, basically, like living in a big mansion, going on holiday twice a year, not needing to worry about where money is coming from, etcetera—then there's no use living as we do now. There's no use behaving as we do now and hoping that the things around us will change in our favour.

Our behaviours are not the behaviours that one would expect from someone who leads the life we want to live. It is only by changing ourselves that we can then change our situation. All of this seems obviously true when you think about it. It brings up the mantra: just do it. If you want to be a millionaire, just be a millionaire. If you want to be happy, just stop being depressed. Have you ever tried to just be happy? Did I ever?

It's something I haven't really been doing. I've just been going to my usual job, doing my work, not questioning anything, not really trying to push anything. And really, that's all it's been. At the end of the day, I get frustrated that things aren’t really moving. Well, of course they're not moving. I'm not pushing anything.

I do get the sense that if I did try very hard at my job, still nothing would really happen. Also, I can't imagine ever really pushing harder in my job. It's not something I really want to do. I want to be that technical person, and I don't necessarily feel like I'm the managerial type, you know? So I'm okay with what I've got now, although it is very small compensation. But getting any more would require a large effort that I'm not willing to put in.

Anyway, yeah, the main point is: if you want to achieve something, or you want to reach your goal, you have to do it. You have to make moves in that direction, which sounds absolutely asinine. Insane. Of course.

Let me give an example. Let's say I want to be a millionaire by the time I'm 40. Let's work backwards. What would make me a millionaire by that time? One thing would be to sell a large stake in a company that I'd built. What would that company be? It could very well be some sort of trading platform, which has been suggested to me before. It could be some sort of education platform. It could be some sort of agency—though maybe not an agency, because that's linked to me and the talent in the agency, rather than to IP or product.

So, anyway, there needs to be something to sell, some sort of value to sell. At the moment, I'm not anywhere near that. I'm not even close. I'm not generating value at all. So, let's work back a little more. Let's say I just start a company that sells something, or trades value for money, or time for money. I'm not even doing that yet.

So, I really do need to just start the value trading if I want to get to that million pounds. It's not quite as simple as "if you do something, it will manifest." You hear about these sorts of people—these gurus—willing something into existence. It's not like that, is it? But at the moment, I'm doing absolutely nothing and disappointed that nothing is happening. Well, I should try something first, and then maybe I’ll have a reason to be disappointed.

It reminds me of that Simpsons quote from Ned Flanders' dad: "We've tried nothing and we're all out of ideas," talking about disciplining his son. Well, I think I'm a bit like that. I haven't tried anything, really, yet. And I'm still disappointed about it. Still disappointed about the zero outcome. So, I need to at least try something first before I can be disappointed. Let's try something first.
