Okay, let's start the second. voice recording. Se to have worked last time, so we'll just carry on what I was doing. Okay. So, what I wanted to talk about today is a few business ideas.. I realised that starting with the idea is not really the right way of doing it. What you should really do is discover a problem, discover a pain point as as it's called. and then work backwards. So start with the result in mind. Find the pain point. And then.. Engineer a solution for it, and then people would pay for it. It solves the problem of valdicting your idea, because it's already a demand for it. I've never really got wrong with that method. I always have these ideas. and I' trying to find a problem for them. It's just a little strange. Well, not strange, it's just definitely the wrong way of doing it.. So that I to talk about a few business ideas. There are a lot of people out today, so I'm kind of being a bit quiet. A lot I walk past people. I wonder if there's a quieter area that I can do this in. I feel just lots of, lots of guys going to work, but I'm sure they don't really mind because they don't understand English. Anyway, that's starting with a few business ideas. One of my grand ideas was habit slap, which is an automatic email service. And what happened happens is you write in a few details about yourself, about your habit, about your goal, And then, every day, you'll get a reminder email to work on your goal and start slacking about. I got got the idea from Jason Levin, who did a similar thing called Elon Email. It's quite interesting, so you email someone who's actually an AI, has been trained on Elon Mus's writing tweets. interviews, things like that, about your business idea, and then he basically roasts you, about your business idea and tells you to stop fucking about, and just get on with it. I like the idea. So I copied it. And so I made have his lap that's what that is. of course, monetising that is really difficult. Why would anyone pay for emails, such like? like that? Lots of different business ideas recently. I've had the idea of allowing kind of like a marketplace of online courses. So my idea is that Eudemi, Corsera, platforms like this, you can pay for courses in any sort of subject. And then at the end you get a certificate after you've done the course. And that's all very great, but if you want to learn something, you can probably get the material online somewhere from a YouTube, from blogs. People will post free content all the time on the subject on any subject. So if you were dedicated enough. If you did enough searching, then you'd probably find the free content online somewhere. So why not have a marketplace where users curate their own educational material around any sort of subject? And the incentive is that people might use your content, and maybe you get an up vote for that. There may be premium tiers, with special privileges, and yeah, basically a curated marketplace of free courses to replace YouTubeeni and Corsera and the like. Because you can find all these things for free online. Let's just provide it for people. Use the community community aspect curate it for free. I'm not sure how to monetise it there. And I'm sure there are free courses on these sorts of sites anyway. So. I'm not really going to pursue that idea. Also, it seems like a lot of engineering work. I have no idea how to to set up a marketplace, although with AI coded like Kursor, it probably wouldn't be as difficult as it used to be. But anyway, I'll show that idea. other ideas that I've had. Well, this isn't really my idea. It's actually my dad's idea. And that is to, again, start with the end in mind, and that would be to have your start up acquired by some larger firm. He reckons that it could be bought for somewhere in the region of£3 million in the next six years, which I find fantastical, but whatever, there you go. So with that in mind, what sort of start up up might be bought in six years' time of £3 million? And his suggestion is basically's going to finance, use my machine learning. machine learning skills and knowledge to essentially predict the market. predict stocks, 4x, commodities, gold, silver, things like that. I think you got the idea because with large language models these days, you can distil new stories very quickly, extract key pieces of information, and then relate that to the movements in the market. Like you couldn't do before. Although I'm sure these types of feeds were included in. machine learning models to predict the market anyway. It's now become much quicker or more accurate. Okay. It's not like. I'd be the first person to try and predict the market using machine learning, using some sort of AI. It seems like a fool's errand. If many people before me have tried this and many people before me have failed, what makes me think that I could do a better job with no experience of trading, markets, with no real interest in that area I'd be starting from zero and I may not even get anywhere. Is that really the best use of my time? Well, let's think about it. I may not be the best. I may not create or engineer the best. predicted model. It may not even be the second best. But there's enough room for there to be at least a competitive model that some firms would use. OK I could probably go quite far with predicting predicting stock crises. But I posed the question. If I did such a good job, why would I want to sell my method to other people wouldn'tt I just sit back quietly and use this fantastic method to generate income Why would I want to sell it if it's making me so much money and his response is basically well. I wouldn't have the capital to really push this method as much as a large franc card. I I don't have millions of pounds. whereas they do. So I can understand that point. Hmm. It would mean that I'd have to really dive deep into that area of things, and I'm a little hesitant, because I look from the outside and the personalities are involved in that area are a little bit odious.m not exactly turned on by that type of type of work, that type of person. So, of course, I'm actually a student. But starting with a few models just from my laptop and then building up to A. seven figure exit. I mean, it's appealing, but I'm going to have to work hard and sacrifice the salary for many years. I just don't know. I think it's a lot more promising than, for example, creating an app, an AI based app,, and hoping that that does well. Certainly adds a lot of ris, yeah. Because any of these apps could just be eaten up by the big players. An idea that I've had recently is one where the user can take voice notes. you know, if you can do that on your phone already. And then a transcript is generated. And as you generate more of these voice notes, I for your own purposes to remember things to know things down, just to organise your life a little bit more. But using large language models, you can then analyse all of this textual data. in some sort of meaningful manner. Beyond summaries, you could track your mood, you could do topic modelling, which I find quite interesting. And in fact, it's what I'm trying to do with this series of voice notes, eventually. I've looked around and it seems like most of these AI note takers are based around wellness, some sort of meditation app with a voice capture attached to it. boil down all of your voice notes into something coherent and then give you a meditation routine based on it. I'm sort of a mood tracker, habit tracker. which is okay. It's just not really the angle I'm going for. That's the thing with these sorts of perhaps you can come at it from any angle, maybe a business idea, a generator, talking to the moist capture. voice capture. About your business idea, such as I'm doing now. And then, it uses those business ideas, checks the internet, does it a deep dive on the subject type. and tells you if your business idea is good or not. Maybe that's an angle that I could care for. positive in this wellness angle. Another business idea I've had is Okay, let's say, you're looking for a new job. And of course, you can you can read the description of the job. But that doesn't always, in fact, it never really does give you a good idea of what the job might be like on a day to day perspective. So wouldn't it be great if you could shadow someone in the role that you're applying for before you even apply for the job? That doesn't make sense sense. So this would work a lot better for remote work because you could sit in on meetings remotely. On site jobs are a little bit more difficult, but essentially, you would shadow someone for the day. You'd pay a fee for that, of course, and the person who is being shadowed, the person in the job of writing, would get a fee as well. And you'd be able to ask questions.. sit in on meetings that are not sensitive, and essentially complete a workday in that role. It solves the problem from the candleace point of view because they get to experiment what it's like every day. The employer, the employer's benefit is that you can showcase your work to prospective employees. So there's an incentive there. I'd have to work out the monetisation strategy a little bit. I don't know how much each party should be charged or should again. There's also going to be a lot of questions about confidentiality. You can't just be going around revealing company secrets. You can imagine the situation where. a prospective candidate is actually an employee of a rival firm, they go in and infiltrate, pretending to be a prospective candidate, but actually, they're just there to spy on the rival firm. It also it's not really about tech, it's about people. So much more difficult to manage. How about a new matching app dating app where if you're matched with someone, then in order to speak with them, you have to first send an introductory video message. This is open to all sorts of abuse, you can imagine, but it does make a little bit easier to filter out the people that you are more likely to get along with. If you see just a 20 second video of someone, you get a much better idea of that person. than you would do if you had just read a bio of them, or just a few pictures that would be heavily filtered. I think there's a lot better. There's a lot. So much better way of getting to know someone. More of your personality is revealed in such a video. Matching apps are so different difficult though these days. I think people are getting fatigued. I don't exactly want to add more misery to an already miserable market But the overarching theme of all of this is that I'm starting with a solution and I'm trying to find a problem for it, which is certainly not the way it should be done. The way it should be done is to find a problem and then engineer a solution for it. So in order to do that, I need to really look around certain industries, see where the pain points are, talk with with prospective customers, and then try and, yeah, engineer solution, solution that people would pay for.. To do that, though, I have. It's not really my nature to do such a thing, though. It means I'm going to have to get out there, talk to people online, in person. I'm much more of a pensive, introspective thinker. So it doesn't really align with my personality very well. However, if I want to do this, it's something I'm going to have to do. I think we'll cooler a day.
