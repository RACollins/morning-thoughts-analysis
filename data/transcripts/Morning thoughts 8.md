Okay. So, just a short, maybe the mornings aren't the best time to do these recordings. I tend not to have very many shorts in the morning.. My mind is blank after the long night's sleep. So I don't really have a lot to talk about. Anyway.. It's the only time I've really get to do these sorts of things that. Every everyone was asleep. I get some time to myself. So I guess I'm just going to have to carry what I'm doing what I'm doing. Anyway. So I guess I can talk about what I'd like to do in my future. I don't really want to work in my job anymore. I think I've reached the limit. I've reached my limit for this job. I can't really progress any further without sacrificing someone my own personality. I had my review a couple of days ago. And I realised that in order to. In order to r any further than I have right now, I'm gonna need to talk to more people or actively seek out. practically seek out people to talk to about my projects. And that's not something that I'm really interested in, particularly in a foreign language. in a foreign culture. I probably could do it. You're right. But it would be such a sacrifice of the sort of person I am. I don't know if I can keep it up eight hours a day, five days a week. I'm finding it hard to communicate with my boss effectively. I'm pretty sure. it would be even more difficult if it were someone who doesn't speak English. for me to speak Japanese.. And all my that's. That's the reason why I'm not going to get intraneous. It's just because I haven't really put myself out there. I haven't really been proactive about my work. All I've really been doing is producing. So, does led me to really contemplateplate what I want to do with my career. And I think the best option for me is to go solo, although that makes me feel very. anxious. Makes me very nervous because of course, I've never done anything like that. I don't really have the confidence or convictioniction that anything I do is worth such money. I have to be very proud. I'd have to be very confident in my abilities, which I think I am. I think I'm confident in my abilities. I just don't think I have a black and white hot passion or something. It's only something to do solo. Yeah. But it's certainly the best thing to do, because I know I can take control of my own destiny. I'd be able to, oh. I be able to really conduct things to my own tune, to my own beef, meet my drum to my own rhythm. Whatever the phrase is. It's just going to be so difficult because I don't really have anything, like a goal or a vision. I'm not a very social person as it is. It's G to be tough to meet connections. Anyway. he just some small shorts I had this sort of earn a lot more to say. Can't really think about me.. Maybe I'. I have to look more like that.
