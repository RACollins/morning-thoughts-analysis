. Good morning. I actually walking around today. It's become very hot recently. So I'm walking with Saturday. sandals, shorts and a T shirt. It's actually quite pleasant. This is the new way going to do things. It also forces me to walk a little bit slower. As usual, I don't have any plans for this talk, just go and see what comes out. I would like to talk about what the purpose of this whole project is. I think it has some potential. So what I'm trying to do is just collect my thoughts in the form of voice notes, transcribe them, automaticallyically, at the moment through app's in builtilt, transcriber, which isn't very good. It gets things wrong, and it just spits out to people will have text, which I need to tidy up. So that's it for the moment. But what I'm planning to do is automate that, probably use Apple's API. Sorry, not Apple's API. Open EI is API. and then transcribe using whisper. Anyway, the user is also able to put written notes in this as well. From there, I want the ability to automatically organise all of your notes. So the big problem I find with note taking apps like Obsidian is that there's a lot of overhead in organising your notes. Now, it's a very basic app, and it gives you a lot of control. However, sometimes I just want to take your ideas down, note ideas down, and then just leave them, have the organisation system work for me, for itself. I don't want to have to bother with tags and links and files and things like that. Of course, that flexibility, that ability to do it yourself is very good, but I just spend so long trying to think of the perfect organisational method that it takes away from just noting down the ideas and getting any use from them. So I want AI to organise my notes for me. That's the first thing, organise my notes. merge similar notes together together in case I've taken down multiple ideas, split larger notes into single ideas, and have them all some sort of structured order. That's what I envisage. The first I've organizedizing, distilling, splitting, mmerging into some sort of coherent order. Then I want to be able to use that structure as context for asking questions of an LLM. So, for example, say I have many notes about my career. and, you know, my preferences for a job, salary ranges, working hours, type of team, type of working itself. I then want to be able to ask the app to generate a CV for me based on those voice notes that I've made and it should be able to understand which notes are important for the context of writing a CV. Now it's already an open source project. There's a couple of open source projects. One is open org E. That's open, OP N. Org, AUG, and then E E is just sort of the letter I. Open orgy, which looks a little bit like an obsidian plug in. And it does the orgization step. I haven't tried it, but I've seen demonstrations, and it looks like it's the sort of thing that I want to do, clusters groups of notes together. The other one is M zero MEM zero. And that is a kind of summarising framework. It strips away a lot of the note, a lot of the text in just extracts the essence, the information, it's meant to be used as long term memory for chatboxots, but I can see it being useful in my project too so that's where I'm heading for this. I think it has potential and I want to be able to, you know, have some sort of application and around it. Or maybe just play around with obsilian. You could achieve a similar result, probably through cursor, the IDE. open cursor at the root of the vault and then ask it to organise your notes for you. I think that might be possible. Give it introructions, give it the ability to make new files. I think that's probably the first step to try. I mean, is it possible to do it just to be cursor? Maybe. I'm sure what I would like is achievable if I cobble together multiple different systems and frameworks. But having everything in one application is, of course, convenient people pay for convenience. So that's that's what I like to. I don't know if it will make money, that's the problem.. It's a lot of work, perhaps.. Perhaps no benefit. So that's why what I'm weary about., we'll see. I've never been very good at making money. I just don't think I have that knack. I don't have that killer instinct. I look at my salary now and it's. It's exactly the same as the salary I received when I first joined this company six years ago. It's not exactly the same, of course, but due to inflation, it is in real terms, the same. It is kind of depressing. But I I've never had that killer instinct. and watching a few YouTube videos of rich people, rich young people, made me realise that I'm never going to reach that level of income because I just don't have that mindset. I'm not that. And for me you expect to be as wealthy as the without changing myself is fanciful. I first need to attempt or move in a direction where I am more like those rich people. I need to change my behaviours. I need to be like those people. The girls was listening to you yesterday said that basically all you need to do is if you act to behave like the people, you earn 100,000 pounds a month, then it's almost inevitable that you will also be able to generate, not be able to generate, but you will. It's inevitable that you will generate 100,000 pounds a month, which, uh seems. seems difficult. Seems incorrect as well. Just being like that person doesn't magic money. But I agree that it certainly creates an environment where such a such wealth generation is possible. He also mentioned that value is where pain is alleviated. That makes sense. People pay a lot of relief paying. They don't pay much for new fancy gadgets or technology. I don't know if my abs solution alleviates pain, certainlyly alleviates my pain of trying to use obsidium, just cl everything. Organise itself. I don't think it will work, actually. Anyway, I'll call her a day for now. Talk to you tomorrow.
