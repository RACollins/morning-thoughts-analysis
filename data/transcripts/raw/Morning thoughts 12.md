Good morning. Um, I'm a little worried about my back. It's been. I thought of a week since I heard it. And for the first day, it wasn't too bad. The next day, the day after I heard it, it was really bad. And the day after that it was also very bad. I had belly bend over, sits up properly. I thought I've done some serious damage. Went to the doctor's got some painkillers, which... disappointingly had quite effective.. And now I've been taking painkillers every day. since. And in the mornings, when the pain period's not working, my back is really hurts. I think every day it gets a little bit better, but it still hurts. It's not right, but if I take painkillers throughout the day, by the late afternoon, I'm basically fine. So. Yeah, a little bit disappointed that I have to pick pain is to get back to normal. trying to cut down on the painkillers, but, yeah, this morning, it just hurts again. So, anyway, we'll see. What I'd like to talk about today is personal growth again. just recount a conversation they had last night my wife. And that is if we want to live the life, that we want. If we want to live the life that we want, to, I don't let me rephrase that. If we want to achieve our goals, basically, um live in a big mansion, go on holiday twice a year. Not needing to worry about where money is coming from, et cetera, et cet. Then it's no use. Living as we do now, there's no use in behaving as we do now and hoping that the things around us will change in our favour. Our behaviours are not the behaviours that one would expect from someone who leads the life that we want to live. It is only by changing ourselves, do we then change our situation? All of this, Arsari obvious. When you think about it. It brings up the mantra of, just do it. If you want to be a millionnaire, just be a millionnaire. If you want to be happy, just stop being depressed. Have you ever tried to just be happy? Did I ever?. It's something that I haven't been doing looking, I've just been going to my usual job. doing my work, not questioning anything, not really trying to push anything. and really that's all it's been, and at the end of the day, I get frustrated that the thing is really moving. Well, of course it's not moving. I'm not pushing anything. I do get the sense that if I did try very hard at my job, then's still nothing would really happen.. And also, I can't imagine ever really pushing harder in my job. It's not something that I really want to do. I want to be that technical person and I don't necessarily feel like I'm the manager type managerial type. You know? So. I'm. okay before I've got now, although it is very a very small conversation. But getting any more is just a large effort that I'm willing to put in. Anyway, yeah, the main point is, if you want to achieve something or you want to get your goal, you have to do it. You have to make moves in that direction, which sounds absolutely asinine, insane. Of course. Let me give an example. Let's say I want to be a millionnaire by the time I'm 40. Let's work backwards. What would make me a millionnaire by that time? and one thing would be to sell a large steak in a company that I'd built what would that company be? It's It could be very well likely be some sort of trading platform, which has been suggestive to me before. It could be some sort of education platform, could be some sort of agency. Agency maybe not so, because an agency that's linked to me and the talent in the agency rather than the IPL product. So Anyway, there needs to be something to sell, some sort of value to sell. at the moment, I'm not anywhere near that. I'm not even close. I'm not generating value. at all. So, let's work back a little bit more. And let's say, I just start a company that sells something or trades value for money or time for money. I'm not even doing that yet so. I really do need to just start. the value trading, if I want to get to that million pounds, it's not quite as simple as if you do something, it will manifest. Yeah. You hear about these sorts of people, these goous, willing something into existence. It's not like that, is it? But at the moment, I'm doing absolutely nothing and disappointed. Nothing is happening. Well, I was trying something first, and then maybe I have a reason to be disappointed. It reminds me of that. Simpson's quite from Ned Flanders, dad. We've tried nothing, and we're all out of ideas. Talking about disciplining his son. Well, I think I'm a bit like that. I haven't tried anything really yet. And I'm still disappointed about it. Still disappointed about the zero outcome. So I need to at least try something first before I can be disappointed. Let's try something first.
