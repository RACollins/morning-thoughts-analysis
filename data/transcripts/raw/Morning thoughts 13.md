one. pretty windy today. Don't know how long I'll stay home. But at least we can talk. Yeah, very windy. Yeah, I'm not going to stay out very long. In fact. I think I'll just walk around the block once and then come straight back. But I guess I can talk a little bit about what been thinking about. One of those things is that. I'm really considering starting a YouTube channel. talking about basically what I am now. I' in a war strike educational way. I think that might be useful a people would be useful for me as well, just to say. bit more confident speaking in front of a camera, just an audience. Also an interesting piece of the advice, or something that I I've already knew, but never already applied, and that is.. It's good to check what other people have looked at. It's research. But it shouldn't stop you from doing the same type of research or the same work just because someone else has done the same. Because you will always have a different angle, a different perspective on the subject or on the topic. So yeah, you shouldn't. stop doing things just because someone else has. It's almost certain that someone else has done the same thing as you. Perhaps you're a better standard as well. But you're never going to learn anything. unless you try. Just by viewing and reading what other people have done, doesn't automatically to learn things. So. You might as well try it first. without really checking with other people who have done the same. Only when you get to a roadblock. Should you then see? Try to find, I think. That's a way of doing things. So, of course, other people who have made YouTube channels around this subject, around the sort of subjects that I'd like to talk about. But that shouldn't stop you from doing the same. There' ultimately, it is about me learning rather than trying to change the landscape to YouTube videos. Okay. I think that's what I'm gonna do today, because it's pretty winding. So we'll stop there.
