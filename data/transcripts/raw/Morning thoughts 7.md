Okay. Very free form today. I don't have any particular topics in mind. So. we'll we'll just see what comes out. I went to the office yesterday and maybe we can talk a little bit about what working from home has done to us in terms of in terms of careers and jobs, and things like that. I think it's I think it's clear right now that working from home hasn hasn't really changed the value that someone can provide to their job. Of course, this is not always true. Some jobs require you to be in person and that's inevitable, you know. Construction nursing, things like that. But office jobs, I really haven't suffered that much by transitioning the work from the office to home. My case, when COVID hit, I almost almost overnight, I went from working in the office five days a week to being completely work from home, only going to the office very rarely, maybe to get my COVID vaccines, which were administered in the office. or to do my medical exam. It seems very a very stark contrast. I haven't really gone back to the office. However, going back to the office yesterday, I did notice that my productivity was much, much higher. I had much better productivity. I think the reason for that is because with other people around me, I was forced to basically concentrate on my work. Perhaps if I were at home, I would maybe do some work, stand up, walk around, get some food, maybe lie on the sofa, have a little nap, maybe. I would get my work done, but it would be much slower and less focusedused. Whereas at the office, like I said, I was forced to be focussed. and I got quite a lot of work done. This goes back to my previous topic of the sugar content or the sugar activities and the vegetable activities or I like to call them the grain, the whole grain activities. give you lots of energy, but spread out over a longer period. And I could definitely feel it. I could concentrate for well over an hour doing quite menial tasks. daily state of manipulation. Managed to stay focussed for two hours almost, doing this very menial, basic data manipulation, whereas at home, I think I'd struggle to do that. Too many distractions, too easy to just slack off. So, yes, lots of whole grain activities carried out at the office. Another benefit, which has been talked about quite often, is that it's a more social experience, of course, everyone in the office. you get to have these cross pollinations of ideas and bumping into people. I didn't really experience that yesterday. But obviously, it did much more possible, if everyone is in the office. Some people might think that's a a drawback of working in the office. I can understand that. I like to keep myself to myself. necessarily need to be talking and chatting with colleagues, particularly for me in a different language. But it was just a to be there and experience office life proper, you know. It made me feel like a real person with a purpose. So, in apricad it was good. I'm not going to the office today. no such. Maybe I take it a bit easier. Another drawback is that, I was just so tired at the end of the day. I'm not used to such activity. Walking around. commuting. Comuting is not fun. But anyway, not. not a terrible experience,. It's a bit of a trite topic, but I'm going to talk about how to find one's purpose in life. It's something that, of course, I've been thinking about a lot recently, one of the reasons why I'm starting this. voice recording analysis slashproduct thing. It seems to be, and to a lot of other people, that your purpose in life is the intersection between four. four topics of Let's call them topics. Four goals. Number one, you need to find something that you like, something that you like doing, something that you can do without effort, that you feel very natural doing. Number two, something that... is good for the world. You know, you could like murdering people, and you feel very little effort doing that, but of course, murder is not great for the world. So it has to be something good for the world. Third is something that makes you money. It's all great doing something you love and you know, follow your passion and everything like that. But if it doesn't pay the bills, it's it's not going to be a very good life purpose. It'll be a struggling artist forever, despite it being something you like, and it being good for the world. So.. make sure you can make a living out of it while it's proper, not a good purpose. The fourth one. I've actually forgotten. I'm just gonna riff a little bit here. I can't remember what the fourth form was. Oh, was it? Something you enjoy? Something that is a benefit for the world. Something that make you money. And four? What was four? I actually can't remember. Something that has a benefit to the world. Something that you enjoy. Ah, of course. Something you're good at. Maybe this one isn't so important, because if you enjoy it, and someone's going to pay you for it, well, I guess you've already reached a standard good enough to be paid for. So maybe that one isn't so important. But anyway, the fourth one is something that you're good at. Hmm. I'm tempted to drop that one anyway. I can't. I shouldn't remember it. And being paid for it kind of covers that idea that you're you're good enough to do it. It doesn't matter if you're not very good at it, because you get paid for it, you enjoy it, and it's good for the world, so just carry on. I guess. So, yeah, these four goals should really be what you're aiming for when trying to find a life purpose. And, you know, it's all very well to define these things, but then actually focussing in on something that you can find in the cross section between these four goals is quite difficult.. I'm. I like to play piano. It's something good for the world. I'm good. good at it. But not many people will pay me to do it. That's the problem will see. I can't make a living out of it. Being a musician is always fraught with uncertainty. Your level of expertise or how well you play or you even how much joy you bring to the world with it, isn't proportional to how much you get paid for it. Trends come on go, and you might just not be the hot topic at the moment. The playing piano is out of the picture. What else? Well, I'm good at maths and science. I enjoy maths and science. It's good for the world and someone somewhere will pay me for it. So I guess that's a reasonable pursuit. I'm a little doubtful of how good I am at those. Which then calls into question whether I get paid for it or not.. There are lots of things where I could be good at if I practice, which are good for the world and that people will pay me for, but I just don't like it that much. So this could be working in finance, for example. and then it's good for the world to generate wealth. People will certainly pay me for it. And with a bit of time, I might might become good at it. But I don't really like it. I don't gravitate towards that, but it's club area. That's a shame because I don't think it sustain me. going forward. However, it's often said that you don't need to like something. And in actual facts, the better you become at something, the more you tend to to like it. So maybe that goble of being good or something is important. Because the better you are at something, the more you tend to like it. I think I finished that today.
