. Good morning. So, as usual, I don't really know what to talk about today. So I'll just, make it doesn't go along. I did have a very vivid dream last night. I was cycling through Somerset, through the Somerset Plains. cycling past Brentell. When behind me, I can see I could see across two Wales to Cardiff. And I saw what looked like, a volcanic eruption. But it wasn't actually an eruption, it was it was the. Dippery. of a rocket launch.. A very nice rocket. I'm not a rocket scientist. or a military expert, but it looked like a nuclear warhead. I saw it. Being launched. but something must have gone wrong because the rocket wasrolled. It fells at the ground. A few seconds after launch. It looked like it fell some. around Bristol. And of course, there was a huge explosion. Now, this point, I realise this. something very bad had happened. I wasn't really in the dream anymore. I was just watching what was happening. And tried to put together. What had gone on. Then it cut to many scenes that people fleeing. People arguing in Parliament. My first thoughts were this must be in response to something going on in Ukraine or in the Middle East and my hearts turned to wow, this is such an embarrassment. for the UK. It doesn't even have an effective nuclear deterrent. And what was the intended target? I don't know. MPP's arguing in Parliament. Setting off. Smoke detectors to suspend proceedings for the day. People running on the beaches of Western. It was all very dramatic. But it got me thinking. in the very cliche way of death and what comes after. Of course, none of us really know. None of us really know what happens after. But it also got me thinking about the documentary then. I watched the documentary of the failed Titanic mission failed mission to visit the Titanic wreckage in a small submersible The Titan, two years ago, almost the day, the Titan dove into the Atlantic Ocean with five members on board. And of course, we know now, but the intense pressure. a few thousand feet, a few thousand metres, I should say. Of course, the hull to implode. They're killing everybody on board. There was a strange time, a few days after the loss of contact to Titan, where rescue teams were deployed and we were all told that if they have enough oxygen, which they did, then they would be able to. They would be able to be rescued. Of course, that sounds fanciful now, now that we know the facts. But he got be wondering again about death. and how although the details of an imploding hull so low so low underwater sounded very grisly. The reality is that the people experiencing the implosion, ironically, wouldn't have experienced anything at all. The implosion would have happened so quickly that it would be on it would just have been beyond the reaction times of humes. So before the nervous system had registered the enclosure and said it's paying messages to the brain. that they wouldn't have been a brain to send any messages to. They would have been no pain receptors because it happened so quickly. The occupants of the Teang would have been blitally unaware of their demise. And it just got me thinking that that would be the perfect way of going. very quickly, without any knowledge, painless, Certainly much better than the nuclear fallout. Even if you were caught in the epicentre of glass. they would have you in those few seconds of dread. Just before the rocket hit the ground, where you knew this was the end. It would have been much worse for the people outside the initial Glaster alias. as they would have died from radiation poisoning. Even inside the blast would not name the peepicenter, perhaps would have been the worst. burning to death. in agony. It may be lasting a few minutes, maybe a few hours I'd like I would much prefer to have been the occupants of the Titan given the chance.
