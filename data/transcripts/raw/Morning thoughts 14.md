. Good morning. I as always, I don't really know what I'm going to talk about the day. I really need to write down the trophics that I'm going to talk about the night before. So I can remind myself, because when you wake up, you really have just nothing on your mind. But anyway, let's go for it.. I'm thinking about starting a YouTube channel. I'm sure I've said this already. In fact, I did say this already. I think it was yesterday that I said it. So I'm going to skip that. I've started reading. just the books that we already have in the house. So I've started off with Jordan Peterson's 12 rules for life. because I need to start doing something different with my life. I'm going to slowly stop playing games, I think. Because I would just play for an hour every evening. I mean, that's not a lot, but it's an hour that I could be doing something much more productive. And I used to read a lot. I should get back into that, so that't I do. I used that hour in the evening. replace in with reading., that's quite hard. I' seen that my reading. reading beaut is very slow. Maybe I'll get better hands. 80, yeah. Practice and improve. Who knows, really? Anyway, that's, uh, just see how that goes. I'm gonna be reading mostly nonfiction. Well, it's almost entirely nonfiction. and around the sort of self help, popular science, business type books, something that will, you know, benefit me. That's what I'm aiming for. Yeah, and I just think that reading Dooky about discipline, because it's difficult to read. It's difficult to concentrate in so long. It's not like I'm addicted to my phone or anything. I'm certainly not as bad as some people. I don't have social media for one thing.. No, I have Discord, but it's not like I keep up to date with people or talk to people all the time. I don't post anything. I don't have Facebook anymore for a few years now. I don't have Instagram, never did, or X. formerly Twitter. And the only reason why I would get these things is because of self promotion. to link it to my potential business. Those are the only reasons. So I'm not. I certainly not addicted, but I can have much more discipline. I could have much more discipline if I tried. So that's what I'm going to do.. Yes, reading. Let's see how that goes. Well, with very few topics to talk about, let's talk about large language models and fine tuning a large language model such that the response is in the style of a certain author or public figure. I've thought about developing a chat bot that mimics the style of Christopher Hitchins. I like to call it Hitchbot. So the idea is that I would get all, not all as much as I could of his writings and then form question response pairs and use those to fine tune a large language model. Just an off the shelf version. Probably open AI just because it's the easiest and most available model. I could use, so I'm gonna go with that. I Yeah, just see how it goes. I made an an analogy of what fine tuning is not quite what a fine tuning is, but what an LLM is and how it responds in terms of music. What music you have, the melody, a content of the music of the melody. And then the context of the music would be what comes before, and an after and a melody. and the style of the music would be the chords or the accompiment, harmony to the melody. So when an alamb responds, it's contact is like the melody. An alam respond with a very honest robotic style, so the chords of harmony are very plain, very average, doesn't have a lot of flair. But the content is quite ipressive. It's quite an impressive melody, even if the chords and harmony are kind of playing. So my attempt to find J and LLM is to add extra melody and structure and harmony to the content. It worked in my head. I don't know that makes sense when I speak it, but that's what I imagine I'm doing is adding, p to the content in the style of Christopher Hitchhens. I don't know if it's going to work. I think it would be better if I found interviews with Christopher Hitchs, because then it would be a question response type thing. Also, if I do find texts of Christivergence, is writings, and at least it forces me to read another book, and it's something that I should do, I guess. I don't know how many examples I need. I read documentation for my tuning. As I' say about a hundred A hundred question answer. H is enough I could start with 100 I' think to curate the whole list though which is a bit my. Anyway, I call it a day for now. If I think of anything else, I'll let you know.
