. Okay. Let's continue. It's a bit raining today.. So I didn't really have a plan. I didn't talk about that, okay? So I let's just see what comes out. I've been watching some videos about productivity. and it's an interesting what about don't great. Of course we will know about. It's the chemical that gets released later. You do nothing pleasurable. There's been lots of talk recently. We' the last few years, I would say. I've helped people, adults, children in life, being dopamine addicts. few examples of this sediction might be consuming short form content. on you Jew or Instagram. TikTok. I hope be kind of. class and that's sort of kind of great. So. Not that. it is that app. It's because while the fears of you date to being, sold to the Chinese or being having access, by the Chinese government, might be true. And also, I just don't particularly enjoy that sort of. I should have sort of contact. Anyway, I digressed. content, pornography. Alcohol, drugs.. Things of its nature, really open. to the user. Release body. And it's. I good feeling.able. It Keeps you high. It Not necessarily that you're quite addictive, s. Also you get one head of doough from here.. See you the next one. And, uh.ata is only just seeking. Don't for me faces. You know you couldn't spend hours, hours scrolling through your Instagram feed, being overstimulated by TikTok videos and it's all the sorts of things. And there's one particular video that I saw on the subject, but it seems to be repeated among other YouTube creators and videos. And that's this idea of lowering your base dopamine level. So the way it goes is if you have this type of addiction, then your day as a graph of time, sorry of dopamine levels over time can seem like a bit of a roller coaster. instantly, when you wake up, you get that dopamine fixed. Maybe it's caffeine, maybe it's scrolling the news, I'muilness. Not the caffeine, but scrolling the news.. And you're do me a little spike very. Very quickly. And then what happens is they drop, very dramatically ends, you don't feel. kind of anxious, you feel angry, almost, because you don't have that opening. See, having a high level of openy tells the body you don't they're in a safe place. And you want to stay in that state, sir. It's like a anxious one of those., what's you about? What's about? Very high level. You crashed down very quickly. So all the body seeks out what it tells you to do very strongly is go find some law. So you scroll through Instagram or Facebook or X, and you get that spike again, and you feel good. And then it cycle continues throughout the day. So you get this up and down, up and down, almost like a roller coaster type graph. And hopefully another overtime. And the problem is that whenever you get snap dip, you just feel anxious and stared and you just want to get your neck hit. I'm sure this has parallel with actualiction. So, the idea, how do we fix this? Of course, we don't want to live our lives like this. And the solution is that instead of consuming, I mean, it's kind of obviously a don't consume these materials that give you a high dopamine.. But it makes it makes sense when you see the g you should be become very low. It's openly level throughout the day. and it's a way to do that to inspire, not over stimulating yourself with these addictives materials. So instead of having the coffee and scrolling the use, nursing in the morning, I have to say that I don't think that's particularly bad. I mean, I've never really felt that' effective. My dad and I don't feel much awake it. And really uses to do use a lot.. But anyway, let's say instead of doing that, you get up and you have a cold shower. You get up and go for a walk, do some exercise. These things stimulate you, but to a much lower level. And the idea is that because these other activities are so addictive. don't mean I give you a so great try and replace those the things that are stimulated to a much lower level. And this one particular guy, I can't remember what his name. It seems to be quite successful. Million of 25 or however old years. that this is how he kept soductive, that I starving his body over all these, I' very addicted activities. He would only allow himself to to get his dopamine fix from doing work. And that was all it was enough to do. Doing work might be, you know, composing emails. doing research, building some sort of product. And I by doing that, you to your face level of both, you very low forout the day. You're not over stimulated. It also means that any slight stimulation began. makes you very excited. It makes you very happy. So it makes you addicted to work. And he drew the graph and green levels nowaday. Of course, this is not signientific, but you can see it very low. openamine level. And then maybe it's like during the evening when work is over, only gets to see its friends while you place some video games or something like that. Iout the day, he's picked his work, is the only way he can get is nothing high or a little bit high. By the good style. By doing well. I have a similar of cy. I don't think you right don't mean that, but I categorise different act activities to actually what do food. So the sugar category. which gives you a quick rest of energy, but ultimately, if you live your life doing these activities, they do get very unhealthy. So sugar, you know, any.ro, food, high sugar, high sal, high fat, all of that And these sort of activities, you, they're scrolling on on social media. or the more worse ones, like the pornography, smokingoking, drinking, These can all go into sugar. And then there's the whole wheat. I can't think of anything. Anything else that you know the vegetables, the grains, the things that are very good for you. I' ultimately give you a lower level of energy. this these typs of activities are, you, long watching. I' watching a long detailed on country. Reading a book. like these activities that Spain for very long time. very difficult, just like eating whole grain is difficult to digest. That's kind of the point. But ultimately, they stained you much longer. I, in my mind, I like to categorise these two types of bact activities. I'm just like a diet. We all know what's good for us and what's about for us. We all know what's good for us a bad for us in terms of different activities. We affected has an art, ne neuro chemistry. and just like a diet, you know, we don't stick religiously to or particular diet although some people are very good at that. We mostly try and go for the salads or go for the bread whole bread, churching factory trying to. As much as you can. And then sometimes we have, you know, the old chocolate of the high sugar yoghurt or something like that. So with our activities, most of the time, we're working, we're reading books, where, you know, going from a run and things like that. But then every now and then we're scrolling on social media. Every now and then we're playing a video game. So I I'd like to use that framework when I'm fig about my productivity, thinking about what sort of activities I'm doing. try and catch down the sugary, the sugary content. I increase my. wholesome, grain filled fruit ofvenge content.. Anyway, I think that's okay for today. I'll sign off now. It's raining a lot. I'm almost like now. So see you in the next one.
