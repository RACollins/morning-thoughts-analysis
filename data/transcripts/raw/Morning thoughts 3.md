So I forgot to go walking this morning not forgot to go walking I woke up in the middle of the night because my daughter was crying and I felt very tired in the morning so I took that extra hour and a half to stay in bed anyway what I wanted to talk about today was just a little update on my business plan from the previous recording. I think it's a little unreasonable to ask people who are searching for jobs to pay even just a small fee to shadow another person's job people who are looking for jobs or are already price conscience. So it's the monetisation model is just not going to work. That's just what I wanted to give a little update on that. I think I'm one to explore more about automization, especially air automation automation. Automations, especially AI automations. It seems to be that everyone is not everyone, but AI estimations are getting a lot of publicity. People are opening their own AI automation agencies. One man, AI automation agencies. I see it on YouTube. I see it on Reddit and to be honest, it seems like something that I could get into some of the numbers that they say they are making some of the money that they're making you know $10,000 a month plus seem a little unreasonable although I'm sure some of these people are making that much money. It just seems to be to me that the people who are making the most money are actually making it from content, teaching other people how to become an AI automator. It seems a little disingenuous to me. They're not making the bulk of their money from the AI automations selling them to companies, but actually they're making most of the money on the courses that they sell on the back of them being an AI automation guru Furthermore, I don't see a lot of these A automation agency gurus nicheing down. I see them as general AI automation gu, but not for any specific industry and I think that that may be something that I could get into maybe use AI automation in a niche, not become I wouldn't want to become the AI automation guy. I'd rather use the skill for some sort of business problem in some niche domain
