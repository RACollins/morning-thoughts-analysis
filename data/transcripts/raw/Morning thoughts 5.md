. Okay. Here is. One thoughts number five, Second week.. I wanted to talk about the day was a little bit of structure. So what I'm actually trying to do here.. It's a little bit like open orgy. It's an open source project that bits of cress. It's a building. I don't learn much news from YouTube channel lately. But basically what he's trying to do is to add an AI agent, a layer to his obsidian cult. I've seen some demonstrations. on some of the main. The core functionality that he's proposing is the ability for an LLM to consolidate. notes. Be able to concatenate. I not concatenate, but merge similarly together to one. Create a Costa. Clusters of similar notes. get topics. I'll do some topic modelling. It's kind of what I've been thinking about as well. It's what an interesting framework, but it's only purpose is to use obsidian. I like Obsidian. I like it's. visual style. I think it looks very nice. I also like the graph view of notes. The problem I have with the obsidian is that it's not very user friendly, particularly for beginners. It's a very steep learning curve. And I get the idea it's meant to be very basic when you first open the app, you can really just make. No, and that's it. You're supposed to build complexity on top of that. Using plug ins, creating your own plug in if you can't. However, I find the time spent constructing a perfect notetaking system, takes away from the supposed benefits of obsidian, and that is it should be be self organising. But yeah, I spent more time organising than house than taking the notes. So I guess I'd like to address that by purely allowing users to take notes. through text or through voice. I think voice is a bit easier. And then just letting the system organise itself. have a very limited set of organisational tools, maybe folders, but ultimately allow the AI to organise the notes for you. I'm not sure if this will be a winner. but it's certainly something I would like to see. And I guess I could do it with Obsedian and I could find the plug ins necessary. I could find all of this. These extra features. but I'm almost sure that it won't be exactly what I want. I furthermore, I'd have to change settings and play around with different menus and things like that, and you know, it's just just a bit of a pain. I just want to take notes. And allow the system to self organise. Now, the really key feature of my system, the one that I'm proposing, is that after you've taken notes, after they have been organised manually or through AI, there should be some sort of generation tool based on the notes. So that means let me give you an example. Let's say I have written or dictated notes about my career. Just very scrappy notes, unorganised, unstructured, notes about my career. You know, something a lot of the lines of, I worked at such and such company for six years. I dr my time there, I enjoyed the freedom. I worked well with my colleagues. I worked on some interesting projects. one involving clustering of weather data. That was refund. I'd like to do that again, if possible. My colleagues were good. We had a good relationship. We understood each other well. I didn't go to the office very much. I'd like to go to the office a bit more, to be honest. OK. Something like that. Let's say that that is one note. You see it's very unstructured, very unorganised, just a stream of thoughts. Now, let's say we have not just those notes, but in amongst those notes are in amongst all the other notes I have taken on very separate topics. I want my system should do is if you were to ask the model, the AI model. Okay, I want you to write a CV for me. It will identify those notes that I've taken about my career and then use them to produce a CV for me. I shouldn't need to tell the system. I shouldn't need to tell the AI model which n to use this context. It should be able to understand which notes are relevant to the task at hand. This, I think, is very powerful because, as we know, large average models need context in order to perform certain tasks. If you have a naked and alm and you ask it something personal, like, what's or when's my birthday? The LLM model, does the LLM doesn't have a clue who you are. Even if you give it its name, unless you're famous, it's not going to know. Anything about you, there's no information about you in its training data. So how on earth is it going to answer that question? And the way we get around this is by providing context to the L lamb. Typically through a rag type system, retrievval augmented, generation, there are some various sophisticated rag techniques, as graph ragag all sorts of different database is And this is how I propose you generate content might be made. to use a type of for access to then inject the query with the relevant context.. It does need to be a CV. It could be. I don't know, for example, let's say I want to learn Thai. the language. and I have some musings in the form of audio notes.m transcribe it if you've written notes about my strengths and weakness exist. My motivations, things like that. They're all embedded in the huge database of notes that I have taken over the years let's say. I asked the AI, please. create me a syllabus to learn tie in six months. It should be able to pick up all of those notes and then generate a syabus based on my strength and wees and motivations. things like that. That's the idea anyway. So this is the value added part of my pers system. I don't think it's unique. I think there are the rivals, other similar systems or applications out there. I notably notetaking apps that then book your next book your next meeting for you. You've just had a meeting, you take a note. And now you want to book the next meeting based on the context of the meeting you just had. So there are integrated systems like that. And I like the idea of having a meeting and then generating some sort of business document from that meeting. It could be just basic minutes. I like the idea of writing up a full personalised proposal based on that meeting. and then have it emailed directly to the client or the person that you've just spoken to. I'm sure these systems exist already, but it's just something that I thought would be quite interesting. Anyway, I'll, of course, continue recording my thoughts on this topic and many other topics and then do some analysis on it. I'm still creating a solution and at the moment looking for a problem. working at things completely the opposite way. But within creating a solution, there are many sub problems that force you to look backwards and force you to look at the underlying technology and learn something about that before you can apply it. So anywhere along the product development pipeline, I'll need to look backwards who knows maybe I'll find that problem. I think the system that I'm proposing is quite broad in the sense that humans generate content.m organise.s generate, that workflow is quite broad in universal. So I don't think I'll have a difficult time finding a problem, just whether it's a big enough problem, that people are willing to pay for a solution. That's the question. Anyway, I know that's okay I'd like to talk about is, uh just how spooky and scary the pace of technological changes, and touching a little bit on what I spoke about in my last note, and that's the idea that you could download someone's personality as a set of weights and biases of a large language model. It sounds very science fiction. H having an AI model speaks exactly like you. You can close someone's voice. add that as an extra layer. Even someone's likeness, you can have an avatar peak in your likeness. Just reflecting on how strange, if that sounds and how creepy it is, but also reminded that when painting became lifelike, when photorealistic painting started to become popular. People must have been freaked out by the fact that you can see an almost perfect replica of someone on paper. I'm sure some people must have a thought this is science fiction. This person is real. But yet it's just a representation. I'm sure. I'm sure when voice recordings started to become popular, people were freaked out by the fact that someone's voice was coming from the machine. perfectly replicated. Some people probably thought that they were inside the machine. photographs must have had a similar effect. to be able to see someone's perfect replication as an image must have been very scary. But people became used to it very quickly. And now we look at photos and we think, well, it's just a photo. It's not real. It's not a real person. It's just a voice recording. It's just a video. and soon we will start thinking, well, it's just an AI model. It's not a real person. Yes, it has a rule of the idiosyncrasies and slight voice inflections. Small. habits of this person, but ultimately, it is not bad person. And in a deeper philosophical sense, are we not just a bunch of atoms knocking around, just as an LLM, an AI model is just a bunch of ones and zeros. What really separates us from the machines anyway, I think I'll finish that today.
