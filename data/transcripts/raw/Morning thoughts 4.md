. Okay. So, let's, uh. talk about the today's topic. That topic is.. Something that on my mind.. something in come with her being spoken about before. at least not at length. that is the ability to essentially down road a person's personality parent store it as a LLM. I have heard conversation about this. Friends, the US sitcom. I think it was Friends. I can't remember that. But anyway, all an LLM is is a very complicated, very sophisticated network of edges. Wes. A probability, that's Pability. What? be the result of the particular input is just dependent on the wes, the LLM. And really, when you think about it, is not our personality, just a probability distribution, about how likely it is that we select a certain word after another set of words. Is this not just what an LLM is? This is... basically our personality. So if we had an LLM, with enough parameters, trillions of parameters, let's say, would it not be possible to then use an entire corpus of someone's speech. The idiosyncrasies capturesured in the corpus, over a wide range of different settings, technical documents, casual conversations, anything. and then train the LLM based on that corpus, we may not even need to try train an LLM fully, but perhaps just fighting June and LLM I find this hasn't really been talked about. And I wonder why. It does seem to a very difficult and technical feet. But maybe it's not all that in interesting for people. I'm sure there are some very rich people who are already thinking about this. Being able to save your personality as an al I would essentially mean that you could live forever. If you download it and then interact with it, once the person's dead. Yeah. I have a. similar idea. It's basically the goal of this project here, me recording my voice, taking the transcripts, and then using that corpus of text. as basically a search database using some sort of rag pipeline Of course, it will not capture my personality, but the information that I have spoken about here will be available for the LLM as context. Anyway, that's just something to think about. It could be something that I pursue in the future. Because although the technology, as it is today, is not adequate. To achieve such a personality download. I'm sure it won't belong until such technology exists. And would it not be better to be at the forefront of a fledgelling technology than it is to wake up one day and have it already fully formed. It would require me to learn more about transforming networks.. Which I think suits my personality, actually. It suits my way of thinking. Let me give you an example. I find it very difficult to imagine or conceive of ways to make money from technologies. The conventional wisdom says that one should find a business problem and and then engineer a solution for that problem using whatever technology is available at the time. I often think about things in the opposite way. I discover a new technology, find it interesting, and then engineer a solution. I then go about looking for a problem that my solution itself. Of course, there might not be such a problem. rendering whatever I created with the you exciting technology, completely useless, Maybe not useless, but at least unwanted and unable to generate value for people. beyond just an interesting tech demo. However, this downloading of the personality, I'm sure some people would be very interested in that. Like I said, rich people who want to live forever. I already have a problem. So now I need to work backwards. Go back to the fundamental technology, study of our value, and then work towards our solution. Living forever as an LL. Living forever as a large language model. Things could get really freaky with video and voice. I don't want to think about that right now., yeah. I really should learn more about large language models and transformal networks. I get basically what's going on. I don't think it's necessary for me to build a largeger language model from scratch. I don't have the resources for that. But at least I understand that a fundamental level, what's going on, I think I do. weights. The bias says being updated and sna trained on large cp. Anyway, going through that course I found online. fast name. I. It looks pretty decent. Lots of people are raving about it, so I might as well give it a go just watching the lectors. I don't know how fundamental of the theory is. It's more of a practical course. but I' at least a few of the lect just. Another technology I want to learn is automation, specifically with N8N. Again. I don't really have a problem in mind that I want to solve with it, but I can have had many problems being solved with it. I'm interested in the technology, so that should keep my motivation.. And then it's just a case of searching around, talking to people, finding business problems. There are already many. Just nothing really satisfy my interest. There'll be something, there, I'm sure. I want to go off topic a little bit now. Talk about. relationships. I see online. I see the online discourse around relationships, particularly with young men. and it's probably be shit, though. It looks like a complete sh. And it makes me very happy that I'm in a secure, long term relationship with my wife. I'm also very happy that we have a daughter together. I can't imagine being a young man in this day and age. slaving away on those matching apps as dating apps, although I was comparatively rather successful with those applications.. I remind myself of just the horrible time I had at certain stages how insecure everything was. how anxiety ridden the whole experience was, if you weren't actually in a relationship or on a date with someone that you, you liked, there was always a sense that you could do better or that the person you're with is also speaking to five other potential partners and you are just one of those. I also remember how disappointed I was actually with the quality of interactions I had on such dating apps. It really is up to the man to lead the conversation. No, I'm not opposed to that. I think that's definitely fine. I think it's perfectly natural, actually. the man would lead such an interaction. However, in my experience, an awful lot of the work was lacked to the man. My wife today talks about the cash ball, how in a conversation, it's a little bit like throwing a ball to each other. And when you have the ball, you speak. When you finish speaking, you throw the ball back. She often talks about interactions with her candidates in the job, and how there is no catch ball. The ball is thrown, and is never never thrown back. It's a one way interaction. That's exactly how I felt. But anyway, yes, as I said, I'm very happy that I don't have to go through that experience again. Very happy.
